## React starter with vite (SPA)
React starter template for personal reference. Will keep this template upto date with 
latest technologies and share the rationale behind choosing each one of them

Includes react-router v6(DataRouter), Lazy loading, code splitting with
- Typechecking:   tsc`
- Linting: `eslint` `husky`
- Unit tests: `tape` `happydom` `react-testing-library`
- Functional tests: `playwright`
- Containerization: `docker`
- Deployment: kubernetes


Rationale behind each tools, libs, configurations are explained in `notes` folder. 
All the rationale is only based on my assumption and personal preference

TODO: 
- jsdocs for types
- lint on commit
